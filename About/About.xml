  <name>VGP Revised Caffeine</name>
  <author>CrunchyDuck</author>
  <description>Returns caffeine to it's original rest value (20% rest), adds in caffeine (coffee) tolerance and addiction, and allows you to assign caffeine intake in a drug policy.

From the moment I began using caffeine in RimWorld, I saw the potential in it. As a (once) avid coffee drinker, I knew coffee well, both for better, and for worse.
In the early days of VGP's coffee, it was far too powerful, which prompted me to make this mod to balance it out in a way that makes sense. Keeping the power, but at a cost.

Now, your pawns will enjoy their cups of coffee a little too much, and become addicted if you use it too much. The chance to be addicted is quite low, and it takes a long time to build an addiction, though.
Before this however, they'll build up a tolerance, making caffeine not as useful unless used in moderation.
Details for this can be found on the workshop page, within the spoiler.</description>
